## [some extra title line]

``` {r even a library}
library(tidyverse)
```

``` {r and even some code}
a_tibble <- tibble(number = 1:10, letters = letters[1:10])
a_tibble
```

``` {r and an image, out.width = "300px", fig.cap = "Ladies Night Homeparties logo"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here(
    "images",
    "LN.jpg"
  )
)
```

  <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/b/bf/Perceptorg1.jpg"
